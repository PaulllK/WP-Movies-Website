# WP-Movies-Website
I took the same movies website idea (from my other project called Best-Movies) and built another website using wordpress, plus JavaScript (and jQuery library) and Bootstrap framework. This project has similar functionalities as the previous movies website, but I also added some new ones such as the ability for a user to have favourite movies, a movies visit history section, movie comments (form with validation), display movies by year or by director or display movies in which a certain actor played.
